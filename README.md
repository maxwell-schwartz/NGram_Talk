# NGram_Talk

Talk for NYC Python's "Natural Language Pythoning" night (April 28, 2016).

Explains what n-grams are and some of the things they can be used for.

Note: many of the functions in the ipython file already exist in some form either in NLTK or the collections library. But I think it's interesting to build them again, especially because understanding what they are doing is the point.
